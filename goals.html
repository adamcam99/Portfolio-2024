					A goal I have had for a long time is to gain work experience in the gaming industry and hopefully work on different kinds of development teams.
				</p>

				<p>
					As well as getting game development experience I would also like to have my own game in development and have a version capable of multiplayer gameplay.

					Being able to build a career as well as continuing volunteering with basketball programs in my spare time would be a great feat to achieve.
				
				</p>

				<p>
					Building a full stack program and flushing it out with proper functionality would be a huge goal of mine as the experience of the full process would be invaluable.

					Working with a development team full time and getting to know colleagues better while developing projects together.
